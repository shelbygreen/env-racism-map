# Texas Environmental Justice Map

## Objective
Guided by the Texas Freedom Network, Climate Cabinet will provide data on race, income, and air pollution, creating a map of disparate impact from pollution in Texas. This mapping tool will help identify Texas communities that are most affected by pollution and that are vulnerable to pollution’s effects. It will be vital in increasing rates of awareness of climate change among the next generation of voters and policymakers in Texas.

## Timeline (Gantt Chart)

## Background
While all Texans feel the environmental impacts of pollution and a changing climate, low-income communities and communities of color feel it more. Spatial, economic, and racial injustices are products of unjust policies designed to further the divide between struggle and prosperity. These major drivers are the reason why 82% of all of the waste dumped in Houston, from the 1930s to 1978, was in black neighborhoods (Bullard, R. (2000). Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Quality. Westview Press). And why there is a concentrated prevalence of chemical plants, but lack of grocery stores, in low-income communities and communities of color (Texas Southern University, 2017). These gaps in distribution reflect the inequitable systems that were designed to keep America segregated by race and class. 

## What is the problem?
The disproportionate, environmental burden low-income communities and communities of color face is known as environmental racism. Concrete evidence (data/mapping) is needed to justify anecdotes and experiences of environmental racism in Texas. This mapping effort will give TFN the leverage they need to organize support and push Texas legislators and officials to act.

## What evidence supports that this is a problem?
The following variables will be explored to establish relationships and trends that support the existence of environmental racism:
| Variable       | Type  | Justification | Source  |
| :--------------| :------------:| :-------| -------:|
| Non-white population       | Socioeconomic | Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks are disproportionately exposed to outdoor air pollution and related health risks than non-Hispanic Whites       | [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html) |
| People living below the poverty line (%)    | Socioeconomic      | Socially advantaged individuals are less likely to suffer adverse health effects because they can afford to equip their dwellings with air purification, purchase newer homes, and/or reside in neighborhoods with lower exposure to air pollution.   | [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html) |
| PM2.5 (and other air pollutants) Exposure | Environmental   | To identify the air pollution burden and chemicals with the greatest health impacts  | [USEPA's National Air Toxic Assessment](https://www.epa.gov/national-air-toxics-assessment/2014-national-air-toxics-assessment) and [the USEPA's Risk Screening Environmental Indicators model](https://www.epa.gov/rsei)  |
| Proximity to hazardous sites* | Environmental  | Individuals who live close (within 1 mi (fenceline zone) or within 25 mi (vulnerability zone) to noxious industrial facilities and waste sites are more likely to be hospitalized for asthma. Communities closest to these hazardous facilities are likely to experience the greatest impacts from an explosion or chemical release—and would have the least amount of time to escape these dangers | [USEPA's Toxic Release Inventory](https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program), [USEPA's Risk Management Plan](https://rtk.rjifuture.org/rmp/location_search/search_by_location/?city=&county=&state=TX), and Google Places API |
| Concentration of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) zones | Environmental   | Potential cancer risks from cumulative HAP exposure have been found to be significantly greater in neighborhoods containing higher proportions of minorities and lower socioeconomic status individuals in this urban area  | [USEPA’s 2011 National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment](https://www.epa.gov/national-air-toxics-assessment/2011-national-air-toxics-assessment) |

*hazardous sites include refineries, chemical plants, energy plants, wastewater/sewage treatment facilities, landfills, and hazardous waste sites
