# Texas Environmental Justice Map

## Objective
Guided by the Texas Freedom Network, Climate Cabinet will provide data on race, income, and air pollution, creating a map of disparate impact from pollution in Texas. This project will be vital in increasing rates of awareness of climate change among the next generation of voters and policymakers in Texas.

## What is the problem?
While all Texans feel the environmental impacts of pollution and a changing climate, low-income communities and communities of color feel it more. Spatial, economic, and racial injustices are products of unjust policies designed to further the divide between struggle and prosperity. These major drivers are the reason why 82% of all of the waste dumped in Houston, from the 1930s to 1978, was in black neighborhoods (Bullard, R. (2000). Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Quality. Westview Press). And why there is a concentrated prevalence of chemical plants, and lack of grocery stores, in low-income communities and communities of color (Texas Southern University, 2017). These gaps in distribution reflect the inequitable systems that were designed to keep America segregated by race and class. 

The disproportionate, environmental burden low-income communities and communities of color face is known as environmental racism. Concrete evidence (data/mapping) is needed to justify anecdotes and experiences of environmental racism in Texas. This mapping effort will give TFN the leverage they need to organize support and push Texas legislators and officials to act.

## What evidence supports that this is a problem?
The following variables will be explored to establish relationships and trends that support the existence of environmental racism:
| Variable       | Description  | Source  |
| :--------------| ------------:| -------:|
| Race       |  |        |
| Income      |       |    |
| PM2.5 Exposure |   |  |
| Proximity to hazardous sites |   |  |
| Concentration of traffic-related air polltuion (TRAP) zones |   |  |
